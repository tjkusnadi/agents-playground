Summary
Implemented a movie search engine with a Gin backend that connects to Elasticsearch, seeds initial data, and serves a frontend for searching and managing movies.

Idea of improvement on search-engine
- Add authentication around the CRUD endpoints.
- Support bulk imports and CSV exports for managing large datasets.
- Provide integration tests that spin up Elasticsearch in Docker.
