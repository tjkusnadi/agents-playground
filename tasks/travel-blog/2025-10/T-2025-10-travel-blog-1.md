Summary
Implemented a minimal travel CMS backend and static frontend with Dockerized infrastructure for local development.

Idea of improvement on travel-blog
- Add authentication and role-based access to the admin actions.
- Provide editing and deletion controls directly in the UI.
- Include image galleries for each place.
